# India's Farm Income Paradox: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Project Overview

This project investigates a critical economic paradox in India: why are farmers, despite consistently achieving higher agricultural output, experiencing stagnant or declining real incomes and an escalating debt burden? Using publicly available government data, this analysis aims to shed light on the economic realities faced by Indian agricultural households.

## Hypothesis

Despite an increase in overall agricultural production, the real (inflation-adjusted) income of Indian farmers is declining, leading to worsening financial distress and increased reliance on non-farm income sources due to inefficient market structures and low price realization.

## Data Sources

The primary data for this analysis was extracted from key reports by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) data.

* **NSSO 77th Round Report (2018-19):** Provides data on average monthly income and outstanding loan per agricultural household.
* **NSSO 70th Round Report (2012-13):** Provides baseline data for comparison of income and debt.
* **Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL):** Used to adjust nominal incomes for inflation, reflecting the actual purchasing power of farmers.
* **Crop Production Trends:** General trends inferred from historical data (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, or economic survey reports).

## Methodology and Analysis Steps

The project followed a structured data analysis approach:

1.  **Data Extraction:** Key income, expenditure, debt, and income source data for agricultural households were extracted from the PDF reports of NSSO's 70th (2012-13) and 77th (2018-19) rounds.
2.  **CPI-AL Data Collection:** Relevant CPI-AL index values for the agricultural years 2012-13 and 2018-19 were sourced to enable inflation adjustment.
3.  **Real Income Calculation:** Nominal incomes from the NSSO reports were adjusted using the CPI-AL (base 1986-87=100) to calculate real income, reflecting actual purchasing power.
4.  **Debt Analysis:** Average outstanding loan and percentage of indebted households were compared across the two survey periods (2013 vs. 2019).
5.  **Income Source Analysis:** The proportion and absolute values of income from various sources (crop production, livestock, wages, non-farm business) were analyzed to identify shifts in livelihood patterns.
6.  **Comparative Analysis:** Farmer incomes were compared with indicative incomes from other sectors (e.g., urban service jobs) for contextual understanding.
7.  **Visualization:** Key findings were visualized using various charts (bar charts, stacked bar charts) to present complex data in an easily digestible format.
8.  **Storytelling:** The insights were compiled into a narrative to explain the paradox and its implications.

**Tools Used:**
* **Google Sheets:** For data extraction, cleaning, calculations, and chart creation.
* **Canva:** For designing the visual carousel document for social media dissemination.

## Key Findings & Insights

This analysis revealed several critical insights into the economic state of Indian farmers:

* **The Real Income Decline:** Despite nominal income increasing from ₹6,426 in 2012-13 to ₹8,337 in 2018-19, the **real (inflation-adjusted) income for farmers *declined* by approximately 3.87%** (from ₹956.25 to ₹919.18, base 1986-87=100) over the six-year period. This highlights a shrinking purchasing power despite increased agricultural output.
* **Stark Income Disparity:** The average monthly income of an Indian farmer (₹8,337 in 2018-19) is **less than half** of what an average urban delivery executive or Uber driver typically earns (~₹21,000 - ₹25,000), emphasizing a severe economic gap.
* **Escalating Debt Burden:** While the percentage of indebted agricultural households saw a slight decrease, the **average outstanding loan per indebted household *skyrocketed by over 57%***, jumping from ₹47,000 in 2013 to ₹74,121 in 2019. This indicates a deepening financial crisis for a significant portion of farmers.
* **Shifting Livelihoods:** There's a clear trend of farmers becoming less reliant on crop cultivation. The share of income from **crop production *declined* from ~47.9% to ~36.7%**, while reliance on **wages (off-farm labor) *surged* from ~32.2% to ~48.7%** of their total income. This suggests that cultivation alone is becoming economically unviable, pushing farmers towards supplementary labor.

## Visualizations

The following charts were created to visually represent the key findings (images are also available in this repository):

* India's Farm Income Paradox: The Illusion of Growth
* The Stark Reality: Farmer Income vs. Urban Service Jobs (2018-19)
* Escalating Financial Strain: Average Debt of Indebted Farmers
* Changing Income Mix: Farmers' Earning Sources Over Time

## Conclusion & Discussion

The findings strongly support the hypothesis that increased agricultural production in India has not translated into improved economic well-being for farmers. Instead, they face declining real incomes and a severe debt burden, pushing them towards non-agricultural labor. This points towards persistent systemic issues such as market inefficiencies, volatile input costs, and challenges in price realization. Addressing these root causes through policy reforms is crucial for ensuring the sustainable livelihood of agricultural households in India.

**Disclaimer:** This analysis primarily uses data from the NSSO 77th Round Report, which pertains to the agricultural year July 2018 - June 2019 and was released in September 2021. While the fundamental issues are often long-standing, current realities for Indian farmers might have evolved since this data period.

## Future Work

* Explore state-wise variations in income and debt trends.
* Analyze the impact of specific government policies (e.g., MSP changes, credit schemes) over time.
* Incorporate more recent data as it becomes available to track updated trends.
* Deep dive into the disaggregated sources of income from cultivation (e.g., cost of cultivation vs. net receipt).
